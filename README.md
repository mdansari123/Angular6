I have created a dummy page with mention which triggers a list when it detects a "@"

As beacuse default behaviour of mention is show list at bottom
so we have created a function while triggering of @ which changes css of list

 Please find functional module "mention" check for eventHandler(event) function which detects for keycode "64" which is @ and then create and apply css
