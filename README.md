I have created a dummy page with mention which triggers a list when it detects a "@" once you select any element press enter in console you will get info related to id of that particular data

As beacuse default behaviour of mention is show list at bottom
so we have created a function while triggering of @ which changes css of list

 Please find functional module "mention" check for eventHandler(event) function which detects for keycode "64" which is @ and then create and apply css



 For dynamic scrool have created ngx-scroolbar module and there You check for oninit function
